Interface and Abstract Class

Whenever we want separation of logic based on  specific classes we use Abstract Class.
To write a abstract class we use "abstract" keyword.
A abstract cannot be instantiated/object cannot be created.
Its sole purpose is inheritance.
It is similar to a usual class only difference is using the "abstract keyword " and able to write a abstract method in the class and it must be public.
Each abstract class must have atleast  one abstract member.

Can a property be abstract in abstract class? Yes
Can u write a static constructor in abstract class? Yes, but it can only use static variable.

Can u use static variable in a non-static method/property? Yes
Static constructor is only called once in the lifetime of the class and its called before any other object of that class is created.

Want to generate employeeid automatically.

static variable when u declare only single copy of it is created in the memory and it remembers the previous value with it.
